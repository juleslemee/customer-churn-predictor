## Project Overview

This project investigates customer churn in telecommunications through machine learning techniques, developed and presented at HEC Montr√©al under AI Scientist Jonathan Moatti's oversight. We analyzed IBM's sample dataset using scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, applying advanced techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for handling imbalanced data.

The project combines rigorous data science methodology with practical application through an interactive Flask web application that predicts churn likelihood for individual customers.

## Dataset

Using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes:
- 7,043 customer records
- 20+ features including demographics, services, and billing information
- Binary churn indicator (Yes/No)

## Features Analyzed

- **Demographics**: Gender, age range, dependents
- **Services**: Phone, internet, streaming subscriptions
- **Account Info**: Contract type, payment method, tenure
- **Financial**: Monthly charges, total charges

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant variables and handled missing values
- **Categorical Encoding**: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into binary format
- **Class Balancing**: Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address limited churn cases
- **Threshold Optimization**: Adjusted classification threshold for optimal churn prediction

### Machine Learning Models
We chose **Logistic Regression** as our final model over Cox regression based on database constraints and project goals, achieving:
- **80% accuracy** for non-churn prediction
- **70% accuracy** for churn prediction

Other models explored:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting  
- Support Vector Machines

### Interactive Web Application
Built with Python's Flask library, the web interface allows users to:
- Input their telecommunications service parameters
- Get real-time churn probability predictions
- Experience the model that was demonstrated to classmates during our HEC Montr√©al presentation

## Key Findings

- Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn
- Month-to-month customers have 3x higher churn rate
- Electronic check payment correlates with higher churn
- Fiber optic internet customers show higher churn (possibly due to service issues)
